# angular2-seed

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.9.

The purpose of this is to provide a seed for Angular 2 with the following...
* [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)
* [Bootstrap 4 SASS](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/)
* [Font Awesome 4](http://fontawesome.io/icons/)
* [Angular 2 Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/tutorial) content

After cloning this repo, you will need to...
* Install [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) globally (npm install -g @angular/cli)
** If you have it installed previously, [you must upgrade it per these instructions](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/stories-1.0-update).
* Upgrade node (if on a Mac use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/))
** brew update
** brew doctor
** brew upgrade node
* npm install
** you might get a node-gyp Python error, if so type `npm config set python python2.7` [per these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20454199/how-to-use-a-different-version-of-python-during-npm-install)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
